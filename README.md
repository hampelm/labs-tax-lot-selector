# labs-bbl-list-generator
A simple map-based tool for selecting multiple NYC tax lots and downloading a CSV/SHP with their BBLs

## About
This tool's primary purpose is to complement other information systems that require a list of affected tax lots to describe a study area, rezoning, or other area of interest.  Instead of a more manual process using desktop GIS software, this tool allows the user to quickly identify the lots in their area of interest through a simple, open web interface.  The user can select those lots that are within the area of interest, and quickly download the lot identifiers as machine-readable data.  

## Customer
Business Improvement Division

## Tech
This is a simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend mapping tool that interacts with NYC PLUTO data hosted on a Carto server.  The client-side mapping technology is mapbox GL JS.  The Carto server provides vector tiles for NYC's MapPLUTO dataset, and also handles the file downloads based on the user's selection.
